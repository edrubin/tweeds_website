  <h5 style="color:black">How is TWEEDS different from other conferences and workshops?</h5>
  <p>
    We're aiming to focus TWEEDS on the <i>tools, methods and data</i> that are relevant to environmental economics/policy/science/studies. In most conferences, you give a quick nod to your data and methods (and ignore the tools). In this workshop, we want to focus on the tools, methods, and data that make research possible.
    <br><br>
    We're hoping that this focus leads us to many conversations (<i>e.g.</i>, workflow, visualization, technique, reproducibility) that are less common in more "traditional" conferences.
  </p>
  <h5 style="color:black">Is there an attendance/registration fee?</h5>
  <p>
    $25 for students; $150 for everyone else.
  </p>
  <h5 style="color:black">Will there be a pre- or post-conference mini-workshop that features more hands-on talks, methods, and tools?</h5>
  <p>
    Probably not this year, but we're open to suggestions!
  </p>
  <h5 style="color:black">Can I present a software package/data product?</h5>
  <p>
    Yes! Please apply to present. We're really hoping to feature these types of presentations.
  </p>
  <h5 style="color:black">It seems like the organizers are all economists; is TWEEDS open to non-economists?</h5>
  <p>
    Emphatically: Yes! We really want TWEEDS to bring together a diverse group of people working on topics related to the environment, data science, and/or economics.
  </p>
  <h5 style="color:black">Can I apply to simply attend?</h5>
  <p>
    Certainly! Please apply. However, if we run out of space, we will likely give preference to applicants who are willing to present.
  </p>
  <h5 style="color:black">What is the presentation format?</h5>
  <p>
    Full presentations will last 20â€“30 minutes (TBD). Lightning talks will last 5 minutes.
  </p>
  <h5 style="color:black">Will there be funding for travel and lodging?</h5>
  <p>
    We hope to offer several modest fellowships for individual who demonstrate need or who come from historically under-represented groups. Apply through the normal application page. See the <a href="https://tweeds.io/logistics/">logistics page</a> for more information about lodging and food (including discounted rates for nearby hotels).
  </p>
  <h5 style="color:black">How often will TWEEDS meet?</h5>
  <p>
    Annually. (With your help)
  </p>
  <h5 style="color:black">Who thought of the name?</h5>
  <p>
    Ed. Someone proposed <i>Practicum in Environmental Economics and Data Science</i>, but we decided to go in a different direction.
