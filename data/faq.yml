  <h5 style="color:black">How is TWEEDS different from other conferences and workshops?</h5>
  <p>
    We're aiming to focus TWEEDS on the <i>tools, methods and data</i> that are relevant to environmental economics/policy/science/studies. In most conferences, you give a quick nod to your data and methods (and ignore the tools). In this workshop, we want to focus on the tools, methods, and data that make research possible.
    <br><br>
    We're hoping that this focus leads us to many conversations (<i>e.g.</i>, workflow, visualization, technique, reproducibility) that are less common in more "traditional" conferences.
  </p>
  <h5 style="color:black">Will there be a pre- or post-conference mini-workshop that features more hands-on talks, methods, and tools?</h5>
  <p>
    We're thinking about it. Whether it happens depends upon demand (vote 'yes' when you <a href="https://edrubin.typeform.com/to/YvQE7p">apply</a>).
  </p>
  <h5 style="color:black">Can I present a software package/data product?</h5>
  <p>
    Yes! Please <a href="https://edrubin.typeform.com/to/YvQE7p">apply</a> to present.
  </p>
  <h5 style="color:black">Can I apply to simply attend?</h5>
  <p>
    Certainly! Please <a href="https://edrubin.typeform.com/to/YvQE7p">apply</a>. However, if we run out of space, we will likely give preference to applicants who are willing to present.
  </p>
  <h5 style="color:black">What is the presentation format?</h5>
  <p>
    We expect presentations will last 30 minutes (25 minutes plus questions). It depends upon demand for presentation slots.
  </p>
  <h5 style="color:black">I applied. What's next?</h5>
  <p>
    Thank you for applying! Applications close 31 December 2018. We hope to notify everyone who applied by January 15.
  </p>
  <h5 style="color:black">Will there be funding for travel and lodging?</h5>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, no. We hope to procure more funding for future workshops.
  </p>
  <h5 style="color:black">How often will TWEEDS meet?</h5>
  <p>
    We're hoping TWEEDS will become an annual event. (With your help)
  </p>
  <h5 style="color:black">Who thought of the name?</h5>
  <p>
    Ed. Someone proposed <i>Practicum in Environmental Economics and Data Science</i>, but we decided to go in a different direction.
